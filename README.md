# Intelligent Data Analytics

Welcome to the **Intelligent Data Analytics** repository! This repository is designed to share my master's work, guiding you through end-to-end data workflows and helping you learn advanced techniques in data science.

---

## Description

This repository covers the complete process of data analysis and modeling, from **data cleaning** and **processing** to **modeling** and **evaluation**. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this structured learning path will help you enhance your skills in **supervised** and **unsupervised learning**.

## What You Will Learn

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Handling missing values
  - Removing duplicates
  - Dealing with outliers
- **Data Processing**:
  - Feature engineering
  - Standardization and normalization
- **Modeling Techniques**:
  - **Supervised Learning**: Regression, classification, and prediction tasks.
  - **Unsupervised Learning**: Clustering methods like DBSCAN and K-Means.

## Key Highlights

- **End-to-End Workflow**:
  - From preprocessing to model deployment.
- **Dimensionality Reduction**:
  - PCA, Autoencoders, and capturing non-linearity in time-series data.
- **Practical Applications**:
  - Storm surge prediction, risk scoring, and clustering geospatial data.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Structured Learning**:
   - Files are organized sequentially (`homework1` to `homework8`), guiding you step-by-step from basic preprocessing to advanced modeling.
2. **Hands-On Practice**:
   - Each file contains real-world examples, code, and datasets.
3. **Reusable Code**:
   - Scripts for PCA, clustering, and model evaluation can be adapted for your projects.
